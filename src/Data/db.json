      "body": "C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language.\n\nA related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the internet. Java is somewhat simpler and easier to learn than C++ and has characteristics that give it other advantages over C++. However, both languages require a considerable amount of study."
